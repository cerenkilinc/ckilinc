# The Relationship Between Social Well-Being and Crime: A Cross-Country Analysis of Happiness, Education, and Health Indicators

## Introduction
This project investigates how social and economic well-being factors such as happiness, education, and life expectancy influence crime perception across countries. Using international data from Kaggle and the World Bank, it analyzes whether higher education levels, longer life expectancy, and greater happiness contribute to safer societies. The goal is to uncover which social indicators best explain global differences in crime rates.

## Motivation / Problem Definition
Crime is not only a legal concern but also a mirror of a nation’s social and economic well-being. Education, health, and happiness are often considered key factors that can reduce criminal activity, yet the nature of these relationships varies widely across regions and cultures. This project seeks to uncover whether societies with higher levels of education, stronger health outcomes, and greater happiness tend to experience lower crime rates. By quantifying these links, the study aims to highlight how social development and overall well-being can contribute to building safer and more stable communities.

3- How does life expectancy, as an indicator of overall health and social well-being, influence crime levels?

4- Among the key social indicators happiness, education, and health  which exerts the strongest impact on reducing crime globally?
