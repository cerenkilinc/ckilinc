# The Countru based Relationship Between Happiness, Education, Health, and Crime Levels

# Introduction
This project examines how happiness levels across countries are influenced by key social indicators â€” education rate, life expectancy, and crime perception. Using real-world data from Kaggle and the World Bank, the study explores how education and health improvements relate to happiness, and whether lower crime perception contributes to greater well-being. The goal is to uncover the main factors that shape happiness at a global scale.
